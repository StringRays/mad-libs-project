#Mad Libs Generator
This generator lets users enter multiple words in given of speech categories. 
If no text is entered in the answer box, it supplies a default string with one random word from each list. 
If no input is given for a category the return for that category is (No input given).

If user enters text in the answer box, they can turn it into a mad lib by replacing words 
with a symbol for which part of speech they would like it replaced by.
